    "\n",
    "Here's the basic pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We send an HTTP request to a URL (like https://api.coinbase.com/v2/prices/BTC-USD/spot)\n",
    "2. The server processes our request\n",
    "3. The server sends back data (usually in JSON format)\n",
    "4. We parse the JSON and use the data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll use the Coinbase API, which is a free public API that lets us get current cryptocurrency prices. No authentication required!"
