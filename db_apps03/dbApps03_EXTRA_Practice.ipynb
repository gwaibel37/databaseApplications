    "This notebook is **optional** and designed for students who:\n",
    "- Want more SQL query practice\n",
    "- Are curious about data visualization\n",
    "- Like exploring datasets\n",
    "- Finished the main lesson early and want a challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Different Here:\n",
    "-  More interesting SQL queries\n",
    "-  Cool charts and graphs (using matplotlib)\n",
    "-  Deeper exploration of the Titanic data\n",
    "-  No pressure - this is for fun and learning!\n",

    "### About the Visualizations:\n",
    "**You don't need to learn matplotlib right now.** We're just showing you what's possible! The code creates charts automatically. Later in the course, you might learn how to make your own.\n",

    "**The Goal:** See how fast and powerful Python is for analyzing data and answering questions visually.\n",

    "### New SQL Concepts:\n",
    "- ✅ `WHERE` - filtering rows\n",
    "- ✅ `ORDER BY` - sorting results\n",
    "- ✅ `GROUP BY` - grouping data for summaries\n",
    "- ✅ `AND` / `OR` - combining conditions\n",
    "- ✅ Aggregate functions: `COUNT()`, `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`\n",
    "- ✅ `CASE WHEN` - conditional logic in queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Visualization Power:\n",
    "-  Bar charts show comparisons\n",
    "-  Histograms show distributions\n",
    "-  Box plots show ranges and outliers\n",
    "-  Color and labels make data clear\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Picture:\n",
    "**Python + SQL + Matplotlib = Powerful Data Analysis!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can:\n",
    "1. Query databases to get exactly the data you need\n",
    "2. Analyze it with Python\n",
    "3. Visualize it to see patterns and insights\n",
