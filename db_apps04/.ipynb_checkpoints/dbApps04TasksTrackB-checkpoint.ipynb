    "\n",
    "Mr. Gurshon \"Gus\" Cohen stands out as one of the few third-class passengers who managed to survive the sinking of the Titanic. At 18 years old, he was a young man whose demographic and socio-economic profile closely matched the specific criteria I used in my search. He paid just $8.05 for his journey, representing the common financial experience of those traveling in third class. I chose to focus on Gus because he shared my age, gender, and economic status, making his survival story feel relevant to me. Ultimately, he represents the most accurate match for my own profile among those found in the database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Encyclopedia Titanic states that Gus was born in London, England, on December 31, 1892. He was Jewish and was part of a large family that moved to London from the Russian Area. He had a printing business, and due to its failure in London, he planned to cross over to the Americas and unite with his Uncle who had a business in New York."
